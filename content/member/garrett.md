I joined the Holmes Lab as a JBrowse developer in 2018, just before work on
[JBrowse 2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) started. After JBrowse 2 was released, my
role switched to working on Apollo, and I am currently the lead developer for
[Apollo 3](https://apollo.jbrowse.org/).

Prior to joining the lab, I was a bioinformatics developer at a small startup
company. I've also worked as a technician in a DNA sequencing wet lab.

I'm a remote member of the lab and live in my home state of Utah, so you're not
likely to run into me on campus.
