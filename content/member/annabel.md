I'm a PhD student in the Bioengineering Graduate Group at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. I'm working on developing statistical and machine learning models to better characterize and understand the engineering of Adeno-associated viral capsids, specifically what's going on during the process of directed evolution.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the Bay Area, folding origami, and a host of podcasts.
