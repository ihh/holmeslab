Quin Lamothe is currently an MEng Bioengineering - Bioinformatics and Computational Biology student, managing three guilds converging on topics related to machine learning applications in cancer and functional genomics.
Primary research interests pertain to computational methods of predicting effective aptamer and ASO sequences, high throughput data mining, and artificial biology to mimic biological processes.
Hobbies include refurbishing a 1972 econoline, spending time with cats, playing banjo and violin, propagating carnivorous plants and mycology.
