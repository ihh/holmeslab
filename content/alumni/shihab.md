In college, I worked in the area of structural systems pharmacology, trying to understand the side-effects of common drugs (like Metformin) by examining the structure and function of their putative off-targets. Currently, I am working on algorithms and tools for facilitating genomics on the web, such as in-browser approximate alignment  and track recommendation systems for genomic browsers.
