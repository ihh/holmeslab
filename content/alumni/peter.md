I joined the JBrowse team in late 2019 in the midst of getting JBrowse 2 Web ready for release. I have been involved in bioinformatics and software development since college as it was a perfect blend of my major and minor. I started gravitating towards software development in my professional life which lead me to working with JBrowse. As a developer I enjoy working in a closely knit team where each member is passionate about the project and helping out the open source community.
