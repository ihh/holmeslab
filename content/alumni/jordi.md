I'm a PhD candidate in the [joint UC Berkeley-UCSF Bioengineering program](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/) and am broadly interested in applications of deep learning to biology.
During my PhD I've focused on computational approaches to improve the [accuracy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.956771v1.abstract) of nanopore sequencing. 
I also maintain interests in structural biology and data vizualization, and have developed a tool for making [simplified cartoons of protein structure](https://github.com/jordisr/cellscape).
