I am a scientist and engineer with a broad range of experience in the life sciences and genomics. I have worked on problems
ranging from basic science to technology development. I got my start in research studying the molecular genetics of
cancer metastasis. After that, I worked on developing vaccines for cancer at the Cancer Vaccine Institute at the
University of Washington. More recently, I worked as a Research Scientist/Engineer in the Department of Genome Sciences
at the University of Washington. There, I created a bioinformatics pipeline and web application for oligonucleotide based
imaging technologies.

I was excited to join the JBrowse 2 team this year. It has been a great blend of science and engineering, encompassing
everything from deep literature analysis to building developer tools and infrastructure.
