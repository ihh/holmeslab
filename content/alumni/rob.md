I got my start in genomics right out of school as a software engineer at the [Sol Genomics Network](//solgenomics.net), and I've been in research software engineering ever since, with one tour of duty in industry at Foundation Medicine.

I've been involved with [JBrowse](//jbrowse.org) since 2012, and now I am the software team lead for JBrowse 2.

I'm much more of an engineer and software architect than a scientist, but I understand enough of the science to be dangerous. ðŸ˜‰
