      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in the Bioengineering Graduate Group at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. I&amp;rsquo;m working on developing statistical and machine learning models to better characterize and understand the engineering of Adeno-associated viral capsids, specifically what&amp;rsquo;s going on during the process of directed evolution.
In my free time, I enjoy exploring the Bay Area, folding origami, and a host of podcasts.</description>

      <description>In the 80&amp;rsquo;s, as an 8-bit game developer, I became interested in artificial life. In the 90&amp;rsquo;s I studied physics, then did a PhD on molecular evolution of transposons in the nematode genome, advised by Richard Durbin at the Sanger Institute. Then I came to Berkeley (via Los Alamos) to think about RNA.
In 2004 I moved from my first faculty job at Oxford&amp;rsquo;s Department of Statistics (2002-2004) to join the faculty on UC Berkeley, going from a postdoc on an exchange visa (1999-2002) to co-chair of the Bioengineering PhD program (2019-23).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a self-styled &amp;ldquo;bioinformatics software engineer&amp;rdquo; for the JBrowse project. I became involved in bioinformatics in college, and did a senior thesis project analyzing ChIP-seq data. After graduating, I attended the GMOD Summer School in 2013 which introduced me to JBrowse, WebApollo, and the rest.
As a developer on the JBrowse project, I enjoy the high quality software engineering work that we do, and take pride in making complex data visualization easy and accessible.</description>

      <description>I joined the Holmes Lab as a JBrowse developer in 2018, just before work on JBrowse 2 started. After JBrowse 2 was released, my role switched to working on Apollo, and I am currently the lead developer for Apollo 3.
Prior to joining the lab, I was a bioinformatics developer at a small startup company. I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked as a technician in a DNA sequencing wet lab.
I&amp;rsquo;m a remote member of the lab and live in my home state of Utah, so you&amp;rsquo;re not likely to run into me on campus.</description>
