      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in the Bioengineering Graduate Group at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. I&amp;rsquo;m working on developing statistical and machine learning models to better characterize and understand the engineering of Adeno-associated viral capsids, specifically what&amp;rsquo;s going on during the process of directed evolution.
In my free time, I enjoy exploring the Bay Area, folding origami, and a host of podcasts.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in the joint UC Berkeley-UCSF Bioengineering program and am broadly interested in applications of deep learning to biology. During my PhD I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on computational approaches to improve the accuracy of nanopore sequencing. I also maintain interests in structural biology and data vizualization, and have developed a tool for making simplified cartoons of protein structure.</description>

      <description>(Cross-posted from ianholmes.wordpress.com)
The idea behind the JBrowse project has always been to bring the standards of commercial software development to genomics.
JBrowse was originally an attempt to bring genome browsers up to the usability standards of commercial web apps. In the 1990s, bioinformatics led the web: Lincoln Stein (a co-PI of JBrowse) wrote the CGI.pm module that was used to power sites like Amazon in the early days, as well as his genome browser GBrowse.</description>

      <description>In college, I worked in the area of structural systems pharmacology, trying to understand the side-effects of common drugs (like Metformin) by examining the structure and function of their putative off-targets. Currently, I am working on algorithms and tools for facilitating genomics on the web, such as in-browser approximate alignment and track recommendation systems for genomic browsers.</description>

      <description>In the 80&amp;rsquo;s, as an 8-bit game developer, I became interested in artificial life. In the 90&amp;rsquo;s I studied physics, then did a PhD on molecular evolution of transposons in the nematode genome, advised by Richard Durbin at the Sanger Institute. Then I came to Berkeley (via Los Alamos) to think about RNA.
In 2004 I moved from my first faculty job at Oxford&amp;rsquo;s Department of Statistics (2002-2004) to join the faculty on UC Berkeley, going from a postdoc on an exchange visa (1999-2002) to co-chair of the Bioengineering PhD program (2019-23).</description>

      <description>I got my start in genomics right out of school as a software engineer at the Sol Genomics Network, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been in research software engineering ever since, with one tour of duty in industry at Foundation Medicine.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with JBrowse since 2012, and now I am the software team lead for JBrowse 2.
I&amp;rsquo;m much more of an engineer and software architect than a scientist, but I understand enough of the science to be dangerous.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a self-styled &amp;ldquo;bioinformatics software engineer&amp;rdquo; for the JBrowse project. I became involved in bioinformatics in college, and did a senior thesis project analyzing ChIP-seq data. After graduating, I attended the GMOD Summer School in 2013 which introduced me to JBrowse, WebApollo, and the rest.
As a developer on the JBrowse project, I enjoy the high quality software engineering work that we do, and take pride in making complex data visualization easy and accessible.</description>

      <description>I am a scientist and engineer with a broad range of experience in the life sciences and genomics. I have worked on problems ranging from basic science to technology development. I got my start in research studying the molecular genetics of cancer metastasis. After that, I worked on developing vaccines for cancer at the Cancer Vaccine Institute at the University of Washington. More recently, I worked as a Research Scientist/Engineer in the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington.</description>

      <description>I joined the Holmes Lab as a JBrowse developer in 2018, just before work on JBrowse 2 started. After JBrowse 2 was released, my role switched to working on Apollo, and I am currently the lead developer for Apollo 3.
Prior to joining the lab, I was a bioinformatics developer at a small startup company. I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked as a technician in a DNA sequencing wet lab.
I&amp;rsquo;m a remote member of the lab and live in my home state of Utah, so you&amp;rsquo;re not likely to run into me on campus.</description>

      <description>A natural question for a mathematical scientist, in any field with enough data, is: what are the underlying dynamics, and the equations describing them? For Newtonian systems, this gives us the laws of motion; for statistical mechanics, we get Brownian motion and diffusion.
In molecular evolution, the underlying dynamics involve sequences, populations, and trees. The equations describe mutation of sequences, migration of lineages, and genealogical coalescence of samples. These equations are necessarily statistical in nature; both because evolution is inherently random, and also because (as in statistical physics) we can approximate a lot of the complicated deterministic parts with random models too.</description>

      <description>I joined the JBrowse team in late 2019 in the midst of getting JBrowse 2 Web ready for release. I have been involved in bioinformatics and software development since college as it was a perfect blend of my major and minor. I started gravitating towards software development in my professional life which lead me to working with JBrowse. As a developer I enjoy working in a closely knit team where each member is passionate about the project and helping out the open source community.</description>

      <description>Synthetic biology is fundamental to the technology of the 21st century. There are many challenges before we can realize rational design of biological systems. At the same time, biology allows for some additional engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, which have yet to be fully exploited.
We are interested in developing bioinformatics tools and infrastructure for synthetic biology including AI, ontologies, information theory, statistical machine learning, deep learning, and web technology.</description>

      <description>As an undergraduate, I quickly became fascinated in the application of computer science to solve biology based problems which led to me to take interest in bioinformatics and biomedical imaging.
After completing my degree at Berkeley, I moved to Washington D.C to work as a software engineer. During my time there, I began to experiment with web development tools and devOps to build full stack applications and micro services.
I joined the JBrowse team in 2020 right before the first release of JBrowse2.</description>

      <description>Our work developing web-based visualizations of genomic data is based on observation of how the consumer web has transformed user interface design. Genome sciences are fundamental to the 21st century, so why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t genome scientsts enjoy web tools that are as sophisticated as those used for web-based word processors, spreadsheets, and maps?
This is not just a frivolous issue: the consensus doctrine of web app design that has emerged in the early 21st century includes many lessons about issues such as navigational continuity and dynamic data representation.</description>
